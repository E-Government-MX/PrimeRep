# What is This Reporitory intender for
Just to start a blank canvas for a brainstorm about what e-government should do and how the use of an open source community mixed with emerging technologies at reach of anyone (i.e. Machine learning, blockchain, github itself :) ) cna help us to finally have the government we want, decentralized systems and empower citizens to be owners of their taxes, their production and the ideas that may lead to the generation of a self-sustainable government without intermediate or personal intersts. 

I am thinking so far of a few:
For BlockChain
- Anticorrucption Systems
- Election systmes
- Open crime database
- Open Cybersecurity
- Open Health
- Open Education
- Better Taxation systems - Transparency

For Machine learning:
- Smart streets
- Smart Houses for everyone

I have the Idea of creating communities inside cities and countries which specialized matters and sustained by our taxes and our production systesm. 

Let's say for example that instead of hospitals there are health communities that help prevent and erradicate diseases, where people can go and learn or treat themselves. Make use of technology to make pre diagnoses, educate society for better nutrition habits, excercising and avoid primary sicknes as heart diseases for fat excess, cancer and other avoidable deseases.

Open taxation Systems in which we can decide according to our tax participation level the amount of money we want to put on certain initiative in order to improve our social neighbourhood, state, city and country. No more legislation by lawyers and senators. 
A species of crowdfunding systems in which once a target is reached it may be suitable to start a project. Everything running under a blockchain system so we now everytime what is happening with the money and how the resources are being employed.

Educational communities in which anyone with specialized knowledge can learn whatever is available. Eliminate scholarship degrees and start working on reseacrh and knowledge, have our own gamified system that tells our experience level in certain subject and help us therefor find a suitable job for out abilities. No more nepotism.

If a person is unemployed or cannot work because of health issues, he still is able to do some other things, maybe it can be self employed for building things that have been accepted by the crowdfunded projects and therefore have a species of unemployment insurance in which in exchange for some work the taxation systems pays to such person.

Among all these ideas the creation of self sustainable houses / communities and cities would be the core of the project.

So anyone who thinks this may be a good initiative worth placing some ideas feel free. 
Would start also creating in other repositories the pilot systems to allow free elections, avoid the costly democratic systems we have right now, no parties, meritocracy and leadership abilities as well as other skills should be evaluated for anyone wanting to be part of an gorvernment administrative system. Imagine for one if we could choose among candidates as choosing someone looking for a job. The m ost capable people would therefore be elected. 

So if anyone has more ideas to come or projects that want to share here please feel free to do it. I am just discovering that tools like github help us eliminate boundaries and start transformating our lives for better.
